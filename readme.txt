Maps a subset of the ODBC API into a node.js plugin.
Includes additional features designed to streamline some common ODBC tasks.

See the source files for detailed documentation.


This was tested on MySQL.  The compiled module is designed to use 32-bit ODBC.
To use it successfully, you must have a 32-bit DSN defined.

The .node module provided is for Win32.  In theory this will also work in a Unix
environment but this has not been tested.

Please contact the author if you find any bugs or wish to request new features.
